The program is chosen by our independent program committee, and they operate under the principle that no-one is paid to hold a presentation, and likewise, that no-one can pay us to get their presentation accepted.",
      "about": "We as organizers strive to create the best possible learning experience for all our speakers and participants, and we expect you to do the same. Everyone is welcome at JavaZone, but we do require that you treat your fellow conference participants with respect. We reserve the right to take any action necessary to make sure this principle is upheld. For more details, see our Code of Conduct that applies to all events organized by javaBin.",

      "paragraph_1": "In an era where environmental consciousness is at the forefront, responsible waste management practices have become imperative. At Oslo Spektrum, an innovative partnership with Oslo Municipality and Franzefoss ensures that waste is not just disposed of, but actively sorted and recycled, promoting a greener future.",
      "paragraph_2": "Upon entering JavaZone, attendees may not be immediately aware of the meticulous waste management system that operates behind the scenes. Once waste is discarded, the process of responsible disposal begins. A comprehensive sorting mechanism is in place, designed to separate recyclables from non-recyclable materials.",
      "paragraph_3": "One notable aspect of this waste management initiative is the sorting and collection of beverage containers for deposit refund, known as \"pant\" in Norway. The bottles and cans are systematically collected, sorted, and sent for recycling, embodying the ethos of resource efficiency.",
      "paragraph_4": "Considerable portions of waste generated during JavaZone are earmarked for recycling. Through a blend of advanced waste separation technology and dedicated staff, materials like paper, plastic, glass, and metal are carefully segregated. The residual waste is further sorted at the Franzefoss plant in Haraldsrud and the remaining 70% is ground up and converted into FOB (refined waste fuel). Franzefoss has an agreement with Norcem for the delivery of FOB and this is used by Norcem as a high-value fuel for cement production. The food waste/wet organic waste delivered is used for biogas and fertilizer on grain fields. This not only reduces the environmental impact of JavaZone but also sets an example for attendees and the wider community."

      "good_title": "Create a good title",
      "good_title_desc": "The title is the first thing people will see. A poorly worded title may be the only thing many will see of your proposal. A good title is catchy and concise, and should describe what you will talk about.",

      "catchy_abstract_desc": "The abstract is what will be featured in the JavaZone program for the public to read. If the program committee doesn't believe that the abstract is good enough to convince people to come to your presentation, then the proposal won't be accepted.",

      "detailed_outline_desc": "The outline is your chance to pitch the proposal to the program committee. This section will not be published, but if your outline is thin or just a copy of your abstract, then you're not selling yourself well.",

      "be_concise": "Be concise",
      "be_concise_desc": "With an exciting theme, it's easy to find many things one wants to present. Don't get carried away. Your proposal outline should explain how you will cover everything in a clear and structured manner.",

      "supporting_materials": "Include supporting materials",
      "supporting_materials_desc": "If you've held the talk before, then please include links to any supporting material that you can show us. This could be video recordings, slide decks, blogs posts, GitHub repositories, photos, etc. Video recordings of any less related talks of yours may also give us an impression of how you are as a speaker.",

      "fill_mandatory_fields": "Fill out all mandatory fields properly",
      "fill_mandatory_fields_desc": "Nothing says you haven't put much effort into your proposals like a submission form filled with 'TODO' or 'TBD' in the required fields. This is fine for the initial submission, but please make sure the required information is filled out properly by the submission deadline.",

      "review_proposal": "Ask someone to review your proposal",

      "live_coding": "Do you plan on doing live coding? Be sure to describe your plan to us",
      "live_coding_desc": "Live coding can make a presentation more entertaining, but it also increases the chances of something going wrong. If the program committee doesn't get the feeling that you have a solid plan for the demonstration, then it might hurt your chances to be accepted.",

Even better, if you are reading this before the Call for Speakers deadline, you can go through your proposal and make sure you do your best to avoid these common pitfalls.",

      "not_enough_info": "Not Enough information",
      "not_enough_info_desc": "The program committee was not sure what you're going to present, or there was not enough information about the technology/things you want to talk about to decide how great the presentation will be.",

      "proposal_too_thin": "The proposal is too thin",
      "proposal_too_thin_desc": "The abstract doesn't convey the feeling that you have put a lot of work into it, or that you have thought through your presentation.",

      "too_much_content": "You want to talk about more than we think you will have time to cover",
      "too_much_content_desc": "10-minute lightning talk proposals that appear to require double that time will be discounted. The same applies to proposals that try to cover everything possible instead of focusing on a specific area. If you want to cover a breadth of material, then be sure to convey to us that you have thought through the timeline for your talk. We must feel that you believe that it will work, something that can be achieved with a clear and detailed outline.",

      "abstract_not_catchy": "The abstract was not catchy enough",
      "abstract_not_catchy_desc": "If the committee ends up with 600 or so proposals to go through, time becomes a factor. This is especially true in the first pass, and in the early stages. If your abstract catches the fancy of just one or more of the committee members, your proposal is likely to be thumbs-upped to the next phase. If not, it tends to drop out.",

      "theme_not_fit": "The theme did not fit in with what we want to include in the program this year",
      "theme_not_fit_desc": "Even though JavaZone has a place for many topics, there are some proposals that do not fit. Some proposals are rejected because we feel the presentation would be better served at a different conference.",

      "co_presenter_accepted": "Your co-presenter had a different proposal accepted",
      "co_presenter_accepted_desc": "If you intend to present with a co-presenter, and they happen to have had a separate proposal already accepted, then we may have to reject your joint proposal.",

      "unlucky": "You were unlucky",
      "unlucky_desc": "We often receive multiple good proposals covering exactly the same topic. The program committee then has to decide between these multiple excellent submissions. In 2016 we received many great proposals covering 'how we do DevOps in the cloud'. Limited space in the program meant that many of these ended up being rejected."
